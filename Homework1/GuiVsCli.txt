A graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with a computer using visual elements such as icons, windows, and menus. GUIs are easy to learn and use, making them ideal for beginners and everyday tasks. However, they can require more system resources and may be slower for advanced or repetitive operations. A command-line interface (CLI) relies on text-based commands typed by the user. While CLIs have a steeper learning curve, they are more efficient and powerful for experienced users. Overall, GUIs prioritize ease of use, while CLIs emphasize speed, control, and efficiency.
